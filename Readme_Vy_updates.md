# EDITS

## ERRORS

- encountered an error while migrating...

```
  File "/Users/aldo/sei/labs/Auto-swap/.env/lib/python3.8/site-packages/django/db/backends/utils.py", line 86, in _execute
    return self.cursor.execute(sql, params)
psycopg2.errors.StringDataRightTruncation: value too long for type character varying(100)
```

### solution

- dropped the database
- edited the seed file, used a shorter img_url for Car.
- did makemigrations and migrated again.

## ERRORS
_images not appeared in the main page

### solution
Doc : https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/howto/static-files/#serving-files-uploaded-by-a-user-during-development

In settings, add MEDIA_URL and MEDIA_ROOT
```
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR,'static')
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static', 'media')
```

In auto folder, import settings and static
```
from django.conf import settings
from django.conf.urls.static import static
```
Then add this at the end of the urlpattern_array
```
+ static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)
```

Comment out all code related to upload route: uploadForm, upload in url, views.

Add request.FILES in views
```
if request.method == 'POST':
        form = CarForm(request.POST, request.FILES, instance = car)
```

In the form.html, include enctype
```
<form method="POST" enctype='multipart/form-data'>
    {% csrf_token %}
    {{ form.as_p }}
</form>
```

Image should be in static/media/ + upload_to(from Car model imageField)
```
In this case, it should be in static/media/pic_folder
```

Finally, in car_list, car_detail.html, add .url for the image
```
before 
<img src="{{car.img_url}}" alt="Picture of {{car.model}}" />

after
<img src="{{car.img_url.url}}" alt="Picture of {{car.model}}" />
```
